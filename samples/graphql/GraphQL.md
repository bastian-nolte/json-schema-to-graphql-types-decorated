# GraphQL

To render GraphQL entitities, we need to traverse the state created via the basic schema builder.

For each type or enum we can reshape the shape generated. Reshaping can add extra metadata as needed, such as decorators for properties and types.

Then pass we can pass the final shapes to be rendered.
